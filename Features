Syntax Analysis: The algorithm checks for syntax errors and ensures that the code follows the correct programming language syntax.

Style Checking: It enforces coding style guidelines, such as indentation, naming conventions, and code formatting, to promote consistent and readable code.

Code Complexity Analysis: The algorithm measures the complexity of the code, including cyclomatic complexity and code duplication, to identify areas that can be simplified and optimized.

Error Detection: It identifies potential errors or bugs in the code, such as unused variables, undefined functions, or incorrect variable assignments.

Best Practices: The algorithm suggests best practices and coding patterns to improve code quality and maintainability, such as modularization, error handling, and proper use of data structures.

Performance Optimization: It provides recommendations to optimize code performance, such as reducing computational overhead, optimizing loops, and improving memory usage.

Security Vulnerability Detection: The algorithm scans the code for common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or insecure file handling, and suggests appropriate mitigations.
